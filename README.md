# Conway's Game of Life in Swift ![Swift](https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-swift/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)

Implementation of Conway's Game of Life in an infinite space in Swift. Alive cells are stored in a set. To calculate the next iteration, we compute the number of neighbors for each cell that has neighbors.

I am implementing the Game of Life in different programming languages to learn about them. You can find [all of my implementations on GitHub](https://github.com/domoritz?tab=repositories&q=gameoflife).

## Run an example

```bash
swift run
```
